# Old-is-the-new-New
Example source code for deprecated development systems.
This repository is planned to contain source code for development systems that were used in the 90s.
Typical examples: Delphi, Visual C++, Borland C++, CA-Realizer, xBase, Fortran Power Station.
It will later contain also sample code for newer systems like LCC, Code Blocks, Free Basic, Lazarus or Visual C#.
Maybe also some script stuff like VBScript, Python, Gentee, Perl or Brainfuck.
The main focus lies on the Windows platform.
